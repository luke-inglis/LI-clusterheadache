**Cluster headache** is a [neurological
disorder](neurological_disorder "wikilink") characterized by recurrent
severe [headaches](headache "wikilink") on one side of the head,
typically around the [eye(s)](eye "wikilink").[1] There is often
accompanying eye watering, [nasal
congestion](nasal_congestion "wikilink"), or swelling around the
[eye](eye "wikilink") on the affected side.[2] These symptoms typically
last 15 minutes to 3 hours.[3] Attacks often occur in clusters which
typically last for weeks or months and occasionally more than a year.[4]

The cause is unknown,[5] but is most likely related to dysfunction of
the posterior [hypothalamus](hypothalamus "wikilink").[6] Risk factors
include a history of exposure to [tobacco
smoke](tobacco_smoke "wikilink") and a [family
history](Family_history_(medicine) "wikilink") of the condition.[7]
Exposures which may trigger attacks include
[alcohol](ethanol "wikilink"),
[nitroglycerin](nitroglycerin_(medication) "wikilink"), and
[histamine](histamine "wikilink").[8] They are a [primary headache
disorder](primary_headache_disorder "wikilink") of the [trigeminal
autonomic cephalalgias](trigeminal_autonomic_cephalalgia "wikilink")
type.[9] Diagnosis is based on symptoms.[10]

Recommended management includes
[lifestyle](Lifestyle_(sociology) "wikilink") adaptations such as
avoiding potential triggers.[11] Treatments for acute attacks include
[oxygen](Oxygen_therapy "wikilink") or a fast-acting
[triptan](triptan "wikilink").[12][13] Measures recommended to decrease
the frequency of attacks include [steroid
injections](steroid_injections "wikilink"),
[galcanezumab](galcanezumab "wikilink"),
[civamide](Zucapsaicin "wikilink"), [verapamil](verapamil "wikilink"),
or oral [glucocorticoids](Glucocorticoid "wikilink") such as
[prednisone](prednisone "wikilink").[14][15][16] [Nerve
stimulation](Nerve_stimulation "wikilink") or surgery may occasionally
be used if other measures are not effective.[17][18]

The condition affects about 0.1% of the general population at some point
in their life and 0.05% in any given year.[19] The condition usually
first occurs between 20 and 40 years of age.[20] Men are affected about
four times more often than women.[21] Cluster headaches are named for
the occurrence of groups of headache attacks (clusters).[22] They have
also been referred to as "suicide headaches".[23]

## Signs and symptoms

Cluster headaches are recurring bouts of severe unilateral headache
attacks.[24][25] The duration of a typical cluster headache ranges from
about 15 to 180 minutes.[26] About 75% of untreated attacks last less
than 60 minutes.[27] However, women may have longer and more severe
cluster headaches.[28]

The onset of an attack is rapid and typically without an
[aura](Aura_(symptom) "wikilink"). Preliminary sensations of pain in the
general area of attack, referred to as "shadows", may signal an imminent
cluster headache, or these symptoms may linger after an attack has
passed, or between attacks.[29] Though cluster headaches are strictly
unilateral, there are some documented cases of "side-shift" between
cluster periods,[30] or, rarely, simultaneous (within the same cluster
period) bilateral cluster headaches.[31]

### Pain

The pain occurs only on one side of the head, around the eye,
particularly behind or above the eye, in the temple. The pain is
typically greater than in other headache conditions, including
[migraines](migraine "wikilink"), and is usually described as burning,
stabbing, drilling or squeezing.[32] While suicide is rare, those with
cluster headaches may experience suicidal thoughts (giving the
alternative name "suicide headache" or "suicidal headache").[33][34] The
term "headache" does not adequately convey the severity of the
condition; the disease may be the most painful condition known to
medical science.[35][36] [Dr. Peter Goadsby](Peter_Goadsby "wikilink"),
Professor of Clinical Neurology at University College London, a leading
researcher on the condition has commented:

### Other symptoms

The typical symptoms of cluster headache include grouped occurrence and
recurrence (cluster) of headache attack, severe unilateral orbital,
supraorbital and/or temporal pain. If left untreated, attack frequency
may range from one attack every two days to eight attacks per
day.[37][38] Cluster headache attack is accompanied by at least one of
the following autonomic symptoms: [drooping
eyelid](Ptosis_(eyelid) "wikilink"), [pupil
constriction](miosis "wikilink"), redness of the
[conjunctiva](conjunctiva "wikilink"),
[tearing](lacrimation "wikilink"), [runny nose](rhinorrhea "wikilink")
and less commonly, [facial blushing](facial_blushing "wikilink"),
swelling, or sweating, typically appearing on the same side of the head
as the pain.[39] Similar to a migraine, sensitivity to light
([photophobia](photophobia "wikilink")) or noise
([phonophobia](phonophobia "wikilink")) may occur during a cluster
headache. Nausea is a rare symptom although it has been reported.[40]

Restlessness (for example, pacing or rocking back and forth) may occur.
Secondary effects may include the inability to organize thoughts and
plans, physical exhaustion, confusion, agitation, aggressiveness,
depression, and anxiety.[41]

People with cluster headaches may dread facing another headache and
adjust their physical or social activities around a possible future
occurrence. Likewise they may seek assistance to accomplish what would
otherwise be normal tasks. They may hesitate to make plans because of
the regularity, or conversely, the
[unpredictability](unpredictability "wikilink") of the pain schedule.
These factors can lead to generalized [anxiety
disorders](anxiety_disorder "wikilink"), [panic
disorder](panic_disorder "wikilink"),[42] serious [depressive
disorders](depressive_disorder "wikilink"),[43] social withdrawal and
isolation.[44]

Cluster headaches have been recently associated with obstructive [sleep
apnea](sleep_apnea "wikilink") comorbidity.[45]

### Recurrence

Cluster headaches may occasionally be referred to as "alarm clock
headache" because of the regularity of their recurrence. Cluster
headaches often awaken individuals from sleep. Both individual attacks
and the cluster grouping can have a metronomic regularity; attacks
typically striking at a precise time of day each morning or night. The
recurrence of headache cluster grouping may occur more often around
[solstices](solstice "wikilink"), or seasonal changes, sometimes showing
circannual periodicity. Conversely, attack frequency may be highly
unpredictable, showing no periodicity at all. These observations have
prompted researchers to speculate an involvement or dysfunction of the
hypothalamus. The hypothalamus controls the body's "biological clock"
and [circadian rhythm](circadian_rhythm "wikilink").[46][47] In episodic
cluster headache, attacks occur once or more daily, often at the same
time each day for a period of several weeks, followed by a headache-free
period lasting weeks, months, or years. Approximately 10â€“15% of cluster
headaches are [chronic](Chronic_(medicine) "wikilink"), with multiple
headaches occurring every day for years, sometimes without any
remission.[48]

In accordance with the International Headache Society (IHS) diagnostic
criteria, cluster headaches occurring in two or more cluster periods,
lasting from 7 to 365 days with a pain-free
[remission](Remission_(medicine) "wikilink") of one month or longer
between the headache attacks may be classified as episodic. If headache
attacks occur for more than a year without pain-free remission of at
least three months, the condition is classified as chronic.[49] Chronic
cluster headaches both occur and recur without any remission periods
between cycles; there may be variation in cycles, meaning the frequency
and severity of attacks may change without predictability for a period
of time. The frequency, severity, and duration of headache attacks
experienced by people during these cycles varies between individuals and
does not demonstrate complete remission of the episodic form. The
condition may change unpredictably from chronic to episodic and from
episodic to chronic.[50]

The specific causes and pathogenesis of cluster headaches are not fully
understood.[51] The Third Edition of the International Classification of
Headache disorders classifies cluster headaches as belonging to the
[trigeminal autonomic
cephalalgias](Trigeminal_autonomic_cephalgia "wikilink").[52]

Some experts consider the posterior
[hypothalamus](hypothalamus "wikilink") to be important in the
pathogenesis of cluster headaches. This is supported by a relatively
high success ratio of [deep-brain stimulation
therapy](Deep_brain_stimulation "wikilink") on the posterior
hypothalamic [grey matter](grey_matter "wikilink").[53]

### Nerves

Therapies acting on the [vagus nerve](vagus_nerve "wikilink") ([cranial
nerve](cranial_nerve "wikilink") X) and the [greater occipital
nerve](greater_occipital_nerve "wikilink") have both shown efficacy in
managing cluster headache, but the specific roles of these nerves are
not well-understood.[54] Two nerves thought to play an important role in
cluster headaches include the trigeminal nerve and the [facial
nerve](facial_nerve "wikilink").[55]

### Genetics

Cluster headache may run in some families in an [autosomal
dominant](autosomal_dominant "wikilink") inheritance pattern.[56][57]
People with a [first degree relative](Consanguinity "wikilink") with the
condition are about 14â€“48 times more likely to develop it
themselves,[58] and around 8 to 10% of persons with cluster headaches
have a family history.[59][60] Several studies have found a higher
number of relatives affected among females.[61] Others have suggested
these observations may be due to lower numbers of females in these
studies.[62] Possible genetic factors warrant further research, current
evidence for genetic inheritance is limited.[63]

Genes that are thought to play a role in the disease are the
hypocretin/orexin receptor type 2 (HCRTR2), alcohol dehydrogenase
4(ADH4), G protein beta 3 (GNB3), pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating
polypeptide type I receptor (ADCYAP1R1), and membrane
metalloendopeptidase (MME) genes.[64]

### Tobacco smoking

About 65% of persons with cluster headache are, or have been, tobacco
smokers.[65] Stopping smoking does not lead to improvement of the
condition, and cluster headaches also occur in those who have never
smoked (e.g., children);[66] it is thought unlikely that smoking is a
cause.[67] People with cluster headaches may be predisposed to certain
traits, including smoking or other lifestyle habits.[68]

### Hypothalamus

A review suggests that the [suprachiasmatic
nucleus](suprachiasmatic_nucleus "wikilink") of the
[hypothalamus](hypothalamus "wikilink"), which is the major biological
clock in the human body, may be involved in cluster headaches, because
cluster headaches occur with diurnal and seasonal rhythmicity.[69]

[Positron emission tomography](Positron_emission_tomography "wikilink")
(PET) scans indicate the brain areas which are activated during attack
only, compared to pain free periods. These pictures show brain areas
that are active during pain in yellow/orange color (called "pain
matrix"). The area in the center (in all three views) is activated only
during cluster headaches. The bottom row [voxel-based
morphometry](voxel-based_morphometry "wikilink") shows structural brain
differences between individuals with and without CH; only a portion of
the [hypothalamus](hypothalamus "wikilink") is different.[70]

## Diagnosis

Cluster-like head pain may be diagnosed as secondary headache rather
than cluster headache.[71]

A detailed oral history aids practitioners in correct differential
diagnosis, as there are no confirmatory tests for cluster headache. A
headache diary can be useful in tracking when and where pain occurs, how
severe it is, and how long the pain lasts. A record of coping strategies
used may help distinguish between headache type; data on frequency,
severity and duration of headache attacks are a necessary tool for
initial and correct differential diagnosis in headache conditions.[72]

Correct diagnosis presents a challenge as the first cluster headache
attack may present where staff are not trained in the diagnosis of rare
or complex chronic disease.[73] Experienced ER staff are sometimes
trained to detect headache types.[74] While cluster headache attacks
themselves are not directly life-threatening, [suicide
ideation](suicide_ideation "wikilink") has been observed.[75]

Individuals with cluster headaches typically experience [diagnostic
delay](diagnostic_delay "wikilink") before correct diagnosis.[76] People
are often misdiagnosed due to reported neck, tooth, jaw, and sinus
symptoms and may unnecessarily endure many years of referral to [ear,
nose and throat (ENT) specialists](Otolaryngologist "wikilink") for
investigation of sinuses; dentists for tooth assessment;
[chiropractors](chiropractor "wikilink") and manipulative therapists for
treatment; or [psychiatrists](psychiatrist "wikilink"),
[psychologists](psychologist "wikilink"), and other medical disciplines
before their headaches are correctly diagnosed.[77] Under-recognition of
cluster headaches by health care professionals is reflected in
consistent findings in [Europe](Europe "wikilink") and the [United
States](United_States "wikilink") that the average time to diagnosis is
around seven years.[78]

### Differential

Cluster headache may be misdiagnosed as [migraine](migraine "wikilink")
or [sinusitis](sinusitis "wikilink").[79] Other types of headache are
sometimes mistaken for, or may mimic closely, cluster headaches.
Incorrect terms like "cluster migraine" confuse headache types, confound
differential diagnosis and are often the cause of unnecessary diagnostic
delay,[80] ultimately delaying appropriate specialist treatment.

Other types of headaches that may be confused with cluster headache
include:

-   [Chronic paroxysmal
    hemicrania](Chronic_paroxysmal_hemicrania "wikilink") is a
    unilateral headache condition, without the male predominance usually
    seen in cluster headaches. Paroxysmal hemicrania may also be
    episodic but the episodes of pain seen in chronic paroxysmal
    hemicrania are usually shorter than those seen with cluster
    headaches. Chronic paroxysmal hemicrania typically responds
    "absolutely" to treatment with the
    [anti-inflammatory](anti-inflammatory "wikilink") drug
    [indomethacin](indomethacin "wikilink")[81] where in most cases
    cluster headaches typically show no indomethacin response, making
    "indomethacin response" an important diagnostic tool for specialist
    practitioners seeking correct differential diagnosis between the
    conditions.[82][83]
-   [Hemicrania continua](Hemicrania_continua "wikilink")[84]
-   [Short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache with conjunctival
    injection and tearing (SUNCT)](SUNCT_syndrome "wikilink") is a
    headache syndrome belonging to the group of TACs.[85][86]
-   [Trigeminal neuralgia](Trigeminal_neuralgia "wikilink") is a
    unilateral headache syndrome,[87] or "cluster-like" headache.[88]

## Prevention

Management for cluster headache is divided into three primary
categories: abortive, transitional, and preventive.[89] Preventive
treatments are used to reduce or eliminate cluster headache attacks;
they are generally used in combination with abortive and transitional
techniques.[90]

### Verapamil

The recommended first-line preventive therapy is
[verapamil](verapamil "wikilink"), a [calcium channel
blocker](calcium_channel_blocker "wikilink").[91][92] Verapamil was
previously underused in people with cluster headache.[93] Improvement
can be seen in an average of 1.7 weeks for episodic cluster headache and
5 weeks for chronic cluster headache when using a dosage of ranged
between 160 and 720 mg (mean 240 mg/day).[94] Preventive therapy with
verapamil is believed to work because it has an effect on the circadian
rhythm and on CGRPs. As CGRP-release is controlled by voltage-gated
calcium channels.[95]

### Glucocorticoids

Since these compounds are [steroids](steroid "wikilink"), there is
little evidence to support long-term benefits from
[glucocorticoids](glucocorticoid "wikilink"),[96] but they may be used
until other medications take effect as they appear to be effective at
three days.[97] They are generally discontinued after 8â€“10 days of
treatment.[98] Prednisone is given at a starting dose of 60â€“80
milligrams daily; then it is reduced by 5 milligrams every day.
Corticosteroids are also used to break cycles, especially in chronic
patients.[99]

### Surgery

Nerve stimulators may be an option in the small number of people who do
not improve with medications.[100][101] Two procedures, [deep brain
stimulation](deep_brain_stimulation "wikilink") or [occipital nerve
stimulation](occipital_nerve_stimulation "wikilink"), may be
useful;[102] early experience shows a benefit in about 60% of
cases.[103] It typically takes weeks or months for this benefit to
appear.[104] A non-invasive method using [transcutaneous electrical
nerve
stimulation](transcutaneous_electrical_nerve_stimulation "wikilink")
(TENS) is being studied.[105]

A number of surgical procedures, such as a
[rhizotomy](rhizotomy "wikilink") or [microvascular
decompression](microvascular_decompression "wikilink"), may also be
considered,[106] but evidence to support them is limited and there are
cases of people whose symptoms worsen after these procedures.[107]

### Other

[Lithium](Lithium_(medication) "wikilink"),
[methysergide](methysergide "wikilink"), and
[topiramate](topiramate "wikilink") are recommended alternative
treatments,[108][109] although there is little evidence supporting the
use of topiramate or methysergide.[110][111] This is also true for
[tianeptine](tianeptine "wikilink"), [melatonin](melatonin "wikilink"),
and [ergotamine](ergotamine "wikilink").[112]
[Valproate](Valproate "wikilink"),
[sumatriptan](sumatriptan "wikilink"), and [oxygen](oxygen "wikilink")
are not recommended as preventive measures.[113] [Botulinum
toxin](Botulinum_toxin "wikilink") injections have shown limited
success.[114] Evidence for [baclofen](baclofen "wikilink"), [botulinum
toxin](botulinum_toxin "wikilink"), and
[capsaicin](capsaicin "wikilink") is unclear.[115]

## Management

There are two primary treatments for acute CH:
[oxygen](oxygen "wikilink") and [triptans](triptan "wikilink"),[116] but
they are underused due to misdiagnosis of the syndrome.[117] During
bouts of headaches, triggers such as
[alcohol](alcohol_(drug) "wikilink"),
[nitroglycerine](nitroglycerine "wikilink"), and naps during the day
should be avoided.[118]

### Oxygen

[Oxygen therapy](Oxygen_therapy "wikilink") may help to abort attacks,
though it does not prevent future episodes.[119] Typically it is given
via a [non-rebreather mask](non-rebreather_mask "wikilink") at 12â€“15
liters per minute for 15â€“20 minutes.[120] One review found about 70% of
patients improve within 15 minutes.[121] The evidence for effectiveness
of 100% oxygen, however, is weak.[122][123] Hyperbaric oxygen at
pressures of ~2 times greater than atmospheric pressure may relieve
cluster headaches.[124]

### Triptans

The other primarily recommended treatment of acute attacks is
subcutaneous or intranasal
[sumatriptan](sumatriptan "wikilink").[125][126] Sumatriptan and
[zolmitriptan](zolmitriptan "wikilink") have both been shown to improve
symptoms during an attack with sumatriptan being superior.[127] Because
of the vasoconstrictive side-effect of triptans, they may be
contraindicated in people with [ischemic heart
disease](ischemic_heart_disease "wikilink").[128] The vasoconstrictor
[ergot](ergot "wikilink") compounds may be useful,[129] but have not
been well studied in acute attacks.[130]

### Opioids

The use of [opioid](opioid "wikilink") medication in management of
cluster headache is not recommended[131] and may make headache syndromes
worse.[132][133] Long-term opioid use is associated with well known
dependency, addiction, and withdrawal syndromes.[134] Prescription of
opioid medication may additionally lead to further delay in differential
diagnosis, undertreatment, and mismanagement.[135]

### Other

Intranasal [lidocaine](lidocaine "wikilink") (sprayed in the ipsilateral
nostril) may be an effective treatment with patient resistant to more
conventional treatment.[136]

[Octreotide](Octreotide "wikilink") administered subcutaneously has been
demonstrated to be more effective than placebo for the treatment of
acute attacks.[137]

Sub-occipital steroid injections have shown benefit and are recommended
for use as a transitional therapy to provide temporary headache relief
as more long term prophylactic therapies are instituted.[138]

## Epidemiology

Cluster headache affects about 0.1% of the general population at some
point in their life.[139] Males are affected about four times more often
than females.[140] The condition usually starts between the ages of 20
and 50 years, although it can occur at any age.[141] About one in five
of adults reports the onset of cluster headache between 10 and 19
years.[142]

## History

The first complete description of cluster headache was given by the
London neurologist [Wilfred Harris](Wilfred_Harris "wikilink") in 1926,
who named the disease *migrainous neuralgia*.[143][144][145]
Descriptions of cluster headache date to 1745 and probably earlier.[146]

The condition was originally named Horton's cephalalgia after [Bayard
Taylor Horton](Bayard_Taylor_Horton "wikilink"), a US neurologist who
postulated the first theory as to their pathogenesis. His original paper
describes the severity of the headaches as being able to take normal men
and force them to attempt or die by suicide; his 1939 paper said:

CH has alternately been called erythroprosopalgia of Bing, ciliary
neuralgia, [erythromelalgia](erythromelalgia "wikilink") of the head,
Horton's headache, histaminic cephalalgia, petrosal neuralgia,
sphenopalatine neuralgia, vidian neuralgia, Sluder's neuralgia, Sluder's
syndrome, and hemicrania angioparalyticia.[147]

## Society and culture

Robert Shapiro, a professor of neurology, says that while cluster
headaches are about as common as [multiple
sclerosis](multiple_sclerosis "wikilink") with a similar disability
level, as of 2013, the US [National Institutes of
Health](National_Institutes_of_Health "wikilink") had spent $1.872
billion on research into multiple sclerosis in one decade, but less than
$2 million on cluster headache research in 25 years.[148]

## Research directions

Some case reports suggest that ingesting tryptamines such as
[LSD](LSD "wikilink"), [psilocybin](psilocybin "wikilink") (as found in
hallucinogenic mushrooms), or [DMT](N,N-Dimethyltryptamine "wikilink")
can abort attacks and interrupt cluster headache cycles.[149][150] The
hallucinogen DMT has a chemical structure that is similar to the triptan
sumatriptan, indicating a possible shared mechanism in preventing or
stopping migraine and TACs.[151] In a 2006 survey of 53 individuals, 18
of 19 psilocybin users reported extended remission periods. The survey
was not a blinded or a controlled study, and was "limited by recall and
selection bias".[152] The safety and efficacy of psilocybin is currently
being studied in cluster headache, with the extension phase of one
randomized controlled trial demonstrating reduced cluster attack burden
after a 3-dose pulse of psilocybin.[153][154][155]

[Fremanezumab](Fremanezumab "wikilink"), a humanized [monoclonal
antibody](monoclonal_antibody "wikilink") directed against [calcitonin
gene-related peptides](calcitonin_gene-related_peptide "wikilink") alpha
and beta, was in phase 3 clinical trials for cluster headaches, but the
studies were stopped early due to a futility analysis demonstrating that
a successful outcome was unlikely.[156][157]
